## AdvMatcher

### Contributions are EXTREMELY WELCOME
AdvMatcher (name subject to change) is currently in a VERY barebones state, and will need a *considerable* amount of development before it's production-ready. As of now, EVERYTHING is subject to change.

It is well expected that this library will be developed, for the most part, by other people (primarily mod devs), rather than myself, as I simply do not have the time to develop this specific project 24/7.

As such, AdvMatcher will have (or already has) a group of trusted collaborators, to manage this project in any way they want.

Anyone else is very much welcome to contribute by submitting PRs!
